As a user I would like to be able to...

Add new movies to my collection
    so I can keep track of all my movies
List all the movies in my collection
   so I can see what movies I already have
FInd a movie by using the movie title
   so I can locate a specific movie easily when the collection grows

Decide where to store movies in code
Decide what data we want to store for each movie
show the user a menu and let them pick an option
Implement each requirement in turm, eachas a seperate function
stop running the program when thy type the 'q' in the menu

Where to store movies:
Normally we would use a database but we don't know how to yet!
For now, store them in a Python list
movies = []

What we store for each movie
we'll create a dictionary for each movie
In the dictionary we'll store movie title, director, and release year

movies = []
title = input("Enter the movie title: ")
director = input("Enter the movie director: ")
year = input("Enter the movie release year: ")

movies.append({
    'title': title,
    'director': director,
    'year': year
})

show the user Menu
Get the user's input
Then run a loop and get their input again at the end

MENU_PROMPT = "\n Enter 'a' to add a movie, 'l' to see your movies, 'f' to find a movie by title, or 'q' to quit"

selection = input(MENU_PROMPT)
while selection != 'q':
    if selection == 'a':
        pass
    elif selection == 'l':
        pass
    elif selection == 'f':
        pass
    else:
        print("Unknown Command, Please try again.")

    selection = input(MENU_PROMPT)

Implement each requirement in turn
